            Introduction to GitHub
        </h1>
        <p>
            Today, we'll begin discussing web publishing!
        </p>
        <p>
            First, we'll establish a development workflow to create a website directory. Up until this point, we've been 
            developing within a sandbox editor that allows us to make changes to our code and immediately see these changes, 
            but honestly, this is an unrealistic and slightly irresponsible way to use the web...
        </p>
        <p>
            Any content/change that a developer publishes to the web requires an advanced network (infrastructure) of host
            databases housing that content, global network servers retrieving it, and then, local internet service providers
            delivering it all to a user.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything that we do on the web is completely reliant on this network functioning reliably, and as artists,
            designers, and developers, we can take precautions to ease this process such as only deploying changes when
            absolutely necessary, reducing file sizes when possible, and generally being mindful of the processing
            workload that we expect from website visitors' browsers and machines. I especially recommend being mindful
            of performance concerning the images that we host: reducing file dimensions to a maximum of 1000px (along
            the longest edge) at either 72 or 144 dpi and downgrading the quality (using Photoshop, File > Export > Save
            for Web) to a maximum of 200-400 kB (.2-.4 mB).
        </p>
        <p>
            For the final project of Section 1 and for many future projects, we will use GitHub to create our websites.
            GitHub is an open-source development platform and community used by programmers and developers working with
            many coding languages. We will use this platform to "commit" (publish) HTML and CSS markup content, host
            files, and organize our code "repositories" and directories to link all of this content.
        <p>
            For this project, you may choose to utilize GitHub Desktop to "pull"/"clone" (download/copy) your code, make
            local edits, and "push" (deploy/publish) those edits to your repository. When this process occurs
            seamlessly, making live edits and changes to your code, it is referred to as "continuous integration" and
            "continuous delivery/deployment" (CI/CD) pipelines. Please note that that the free version of GitHub Desktop
            limits users to 2,000 CI/CD minutes per month. For this project, I don't foresee this being a problem, but
            you may find that this is insufficient, and for this reason, our demo is going to be oriented toward
            establishing a work environment where you can make local edits and manually commit those edits to GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, we need to set up a GitHub account. I recommend some iteration of your Penn Email (minus the @[...]) 
            as your username:
        </p>

        <div id="slider">
            <input type="radio" name="slider1" id="slide1nav" checked>
            <input type="radio" name="slider1" id="slide2nav">
            <input type="radio" name="slider1" id="slide3nav">
            <div id="slides">
                <div class="inner">
                    <img src="1.png" alt="GitHub landing page" class="slide slide_1">
                    <img src="2.png" alt="GitHub email signup" class="slide slide_2">
                    <img src="3.png" alt="GitHub annoying robot check" class="slide slide_3">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Next, we need to initialize our first repository (use [username].github.io) and give it an index.html file:
        </p>
        <div id="slider">
            <input type="radio" name="slider2" id="slide1nav" checked>
            <input type="radio" name="slider2" id="slide2nav">
            <input type="radio" name="slider2" id="slide3nav">
            <input type="radio" name="slider2" id="slide4nav">
            <div id="slides">
                <div class="inner">
                    <img src="4.png" alt="New is highlighted on the user page" class="slide slide_1">
                    <img src="5.png" alt="Using user.github.io on the Create a new repository page " class="slide slide_2">
                    <img src="6.png" alt="creating a new file is highlighted on the repository page" class="slide slide_3">
                    <img src="7.png" alt="The file is titled index.html and Hello, World! is written inside the file" class="slide slide_4">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            And lastly, we need to navigate to Settings > Pages to tell GitHub Pages to recognize this repository as the home 
            directory (main branch) for our website:
        </p>
        <div id="slider">
            <input type="radio" name="slider3" id="slide1nav" checked>
            <input type="radio" name="slider3" id="slide2nav">
            <input type="radio" name="slider3" id="slide3nav">
            <div id="slides">
                <div class="inner">
                    <img src="8.png" alt="index.html now exists on the repository page" class="slide slide_1">
                    <img src="9.png" alt="On the Settings page, Settings and Pages are highlighted in the top and sidebar navigation" class="slide slide_2">
                    <img src="10.png" alt="Under the section in Pages, main, /(root) and save are highlighted" class="slide slide_3">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Give it a few seconds, and in your browser, navigate to [username].github.io, and hey! Look at that! You made a website!
            Now, I'm going to link to my <a href="2.html">second page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Most websites that you use on a regular basis are essentially just files inside of folders (directories). These files link 
            and reference each other to establish a contextual relationship. Many future assignments for this class will require us to 
            establish an adequate workflow between "pulling" our code, making changes to these files on our local environments with a 
            text editor (files inside of folders on the computer), then uploading and committing the contents within the folder to publish
            it as web content.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll start by downloading a copy of all code in our pages repository and renaming it with the current time 
            and date so that we'll eventually have many backups of our work on our computers. Next, we'll edit the files in an editor 
            (recommended Visual Studio Code with extensions: "Live Preview" and "Open in Browser"). And finally, we can upload our changes
            back to GitHub. Any file with the same name will automatically overwrite its old version, so be sure to maintain the copies of
            your work somewhere (such as OneDrive) in case you need to revert to or reference an older version of your site.
        </p>
        <div id="slider">
            <input type="radio" name="slider4" id="slide1nav" checked>
            <input type="radio" name="slider4" id="slide2nav">
            <input type="radio" name="slider4" id="slide3nav">
            <div id="slides">
                <div class="inner">
                    <img src="11.png" alt="From the main page of my pages repository, the Code dropdown and Download Zip button are highlighted" class="slide slide_1">
                    <img src="12.png" alt="An example of the documents in my downloads folder to reflect the current version of my site" class="slide slide_2">
                    <img src="13.png" alt="An example of editing the files in VSCode" class="slide slide_3">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            When you go to upload your files, remember to scroll down to the bottom of the page and "commit" those changes (the upload).
        </p>
        <div id="slider">
            <input type="radio" name="slider5" id="slide1nav" checked>
            <input type="radio" name="slider5" id="slide2nav">
            <input type="radio" name="slider5" id="slide3nav">
            <div id="slides">
                <div class="inner">
                    <img src="14.png" alt="From the main page of my pages repository, the + Add dropdown and Upload Files button are highlighted" class="slide slide_1">
                    <img src="15.png" alt="The upload file page shows that you can drag your files into the browser or manually select them from your computer" class="slide slide_2">
                    <img src="16.png" alt="Students always forget to do this and get frustrated. The Commit Changes button is highlighted at the bottom of the page" class="slide slide_3">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Now, you know enough to cause some serious damage. The main reason there's a lag between pushing your changes and those 
            changes being visible is so GitHub can scan everything and make sure you're not uploading anything dangerous... Have fun!
        </p>
